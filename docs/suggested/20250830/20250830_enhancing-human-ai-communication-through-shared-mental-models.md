## Collaboration Experiment: Building a Shared Mental Model with an AI Collaborator

### What You'll Do
Readers will work with an AI system to complete a collaborative task, such as planning a complex project or solving an open-ended problem. Throughout the process, they will engage in activities designed to build a shared understanding of the task, the AI's capabilities, and the team's goals.

### Expected Outcomes  
Readers will gain firsthand experience in the process of developing a shared mental model with an AI collaborator, and observe how this impacts the quality and efficiency of their joint problem-solving.

### Time Commitment
1-2 hours

### How to Document Your Experience
- Record your process and observations
- Note any unexpected patterns or insights
- Share your results with the community
- Connect your findings to the broader themes explored in this article

## Discussion Questions
