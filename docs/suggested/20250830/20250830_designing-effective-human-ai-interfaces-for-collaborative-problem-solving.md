## Collaboration Experiment: Designing a Human-AI Collaborative Interface

### What You'll Do
Readers will work in teams to design and prototype an interface for a specific human-AI collaboration task. They will explore different interaction modalities, visualizations, and control mechanisms, then test their designs with users.

### Expected Outcomes  
Readers will gain hands-on experience in designing human-centric AI interfaces and observing how these designs impact the quality and efficiency of human-AI collaboration.

### Time Commitment
2-3 hours

### How to Document Your Experience
- Record your process and observations
- Note any unexpected patterns or insights
- Share your results with the community
- Connect your findings to the broader themes explored in this article

## Discussion Questions
