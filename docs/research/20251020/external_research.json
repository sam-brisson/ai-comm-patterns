We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning.

Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.

        "summary": "Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image, mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled, 300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863, surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

        "summary": "Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

        "summary": "We report the precise X-ray localization of GRB~230906A, a short duration ($T_{90}\\sim$0.9 s) burst with no optical or radio counterpart. Deep imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope detects a faint galaxy (G$^\\ast$; $F160W\\simeq26$ AB mag) coincident with the sub-arcsecond X-ray position. Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color would suggest a high redshift ($z\\gtrsim$3) host. However, our observations also reveal the presence of a galaxy group at $z\\!\\sim$0.453, confirmed spectroscopically with VLT/MUSE, with clear signs of interactions and mergers among group members. The GRB and its putative host project onto an extended ($\\approx$180 kpc) tidal tail emerging from the group's central galaxy. The probability of a chance alignment is small ($P_{cc}\\!\\lesssim\\!4$\\%), we thus argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar location along the tidal debris suggests that an enhanced burst of star formation, induced by the galaxy merger, might have formed the progenitor compact binary $\\lesssim$700 Myr ago. The compact binary later evolved in a neutron star merger which produced GRB 230906A and injected $r$-process material into the surrounding circumgalactic medium.",

        "summary": "The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features, grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.",
