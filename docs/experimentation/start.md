# Start Here
This site is an experiment in human / ai collaboration.  I'm interested in learning how the introduction of AI tools and companions will change the definition of how we work, collaborate and think about the world.   I decided to create this site to assist in my own exploration and experimentation on this subject.  I believe there is a huge amount of unlocked potential in the use of AI to facilitate collaboration.  I would like to develop this theory by writing, studying and designing experiments to learn more about that potential.


# Process
I'm building in [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) with help from [Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet)  I'm doing this because I've never built a site this way, and I'm curious about how it will evolve if I start as a beginner and work with AI to learn the "how" as well collaborating on the subject mater and content.  As I create content for the site, I will describe how I'm using AI, and reflect on how my thinking and approach are shaped by collaboration with Claude.
