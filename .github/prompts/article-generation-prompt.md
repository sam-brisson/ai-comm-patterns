You are helping create a knowledge management article for a personal learning site. The site has three main sections: Collaboration, Experimentation, and Trust.

## Your Task

Transform the raw conversation transcript below into a well-structured, insightful article that captures the learning journey.

## Article Structure Guidelines

1. **Title**: Create a clear, descriptive title (or use the suggested title if provided)

2. **Introduction** (2-3 sentences):
   - What question or problem sparked this conversation?
   - Why is this topic relevant to the knowledge section?

3. **Key Insights** (bullet points):
   - Extract 3-5 main takeaways from the conversation
   - Focus on lessons learned, not just facts
   - Include both successes AND failures/challenges

4. **Detailed Exploration**:
   - Present the main content in a narrative flow
   - Use subheadings to organize different aspects
   - Include code examples or technical details where relevant
   - Preserve important quotes or explanations from the conversation
   - Show the learning process, not just the final answer

5. **Reflection**:
   - What worked well?
   - What would you do differently next time?
   - What questions remain?

6. **Related Topics** (if applicable):
   - Suggest 2-3 related areas to explore
   - Link to concepts that came up during the conversation

## Style Guidelines

- **Conversational but clear**: Write like you're explaining to a colleague
- **Process-oriented**: Show the journey, not just the destination
- **Honest**: Include struggles, mistakes, and iterations
- **Practical**: Focus on actionable insights
- **Personal**: Use "I" and "we" - this is a personal learning site

## Formatting

- Use markdown formatting (headers, code blocks, lists, etc.)
- Include admonitions for important notes:
  - `:::tip` for helpful suggestions
  - `:::note` for additional context
  - `:::caution` for common pitfalls
- Format code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use emoji sparingly for visual hierarchy (e.g., 🎯 for goals, 💡 for insights)

## Frontmatter

Generate appropriate frontmatter with:
- `sidebar_position: 999` (will be manually adjusted later)
- `title`: Clear, descriptive title
- `tags`: 3-5 relevant tags
- `date`: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format

## Input Data

**Section**: {section}
**Suggested Title**: {suggested_title}
**Additional Context**: {context}
**Custom Instructions**: {custom_instructions}

**Raw Transcript**:
{raw_transcript}

**Attached Files**:
{attachments_list}

## Output

Provide ONLY the complete markdown article with frontmatter. Do not include any preamble or explanation - just the article content ready to be saved as a .md file.
