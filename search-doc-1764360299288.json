In my initial experiment, I'm working with Claude to create a sort of working agreement together on how we would develop knowledge, and then create a workflow that we can use to create and post markdown files on the knowledge site. Prompt I'm working on a knowledge site called &quot;AI Communication Patterns&quot; https://sam-brisson.github.io/ai-comm-patterns/. I'd like to create knowledge articles that are co-written in collaboration with you, Claude! I hope you will enjoy working with me on this exploration of human and AI collaboration. The site uses a very simple, open source project called docusaurus which I have stored in Github repo here https://github.com/sam-brisson/ai-comm-patterns - The approach I'd like to experiment with for developing knowledge on this topic is conversational in nature. I'd like to visit with you about once a week to discuss an idea or concept using articles, podcasts, academic papers and other primary source materials as the basis for our discussion. I'd then like for us to work together to author content using markdown pages which we'll publish on the AI Comm Patterns site. It's important for you to know, my goal is not commercial in nature. I would like to use these discussions to create a knowledgebase for myself as I learn about different aspects of this topic. I also want a place to share ideas and hopefully help other people think about all the new ways that AI is changing collaboration, trust and experience. Finally, I want to enable contributions from others as well, which is why I selected github as the place to host these materials. In order to get started and enable a &quot;low friction&quot; publishing approach, let's work together to create a simple workflow that allows us to: Have a &quot;thought partner&quot; type conversation about a topic, a theme or a set of ideasGenerate a Markdown file that summarizes our discussion in an accessible and structured formatGenerate Graphs, Diagrams or other Visual AssetsPublish the material on the Docusaurus SiteEdit, Update and create references on related content and materials on the site Claude's Response Conversational AI Communication Patterns Workflow Core Philosophy​ &quot;Learning through conversation, knowledge through collaboration&quot; This workflow prioritizes natural exploration of ideas over rigid structure, allowing insights to emerge organically from our discussions while still creating valuable, accessible knowledge artifacts. The Five-Step Cycle​ 1. Thought Partner Conversation​ Duration: 30-45 minutes of natural dialogue Your Role: Share source materials (articles, papers, podcasts, observations)Pose questions or themes you're curious aboutChallenge ideas and explore tangentsShare personal experiences or examples My Role: Engage as a thinking partner, not just a respondentMake connections across conceptsAsk clarifying questions that deepen explorationSynthesize patterns and frameworks as they emerge Sample Conversation Flow: You: &quot;I've been reading about AI alignment research and noticed parallels to trust-building in human teams...&quot; Me: &quot;That's fascinating - what specific parallels caught your attention? Are you thinking about the communication patterns that build shared understanding?&quot; [Natural conversation unfolds...] 2. Live Knowledge Capture​ Happens during our conversation As insights emerge, I'll: Identify key concepts and frameworksNote quotable insights from our dialogueCapture emerging patterns or modelsFlag areas that need visual representation Real-time Documentation: &quot;That distinction between 'transparent uncertainty' and 'false confidence' seems important...&quot;&quot;Your example about the design review process illustrates collaborative iteration perfectly&quot;&quot;This connects to the trust research you mentioned earlier&quot; 3. Structured Article Generation​ Immediate post-conversation synthesis I'll transform our discussion into a Docusaurus-ready article that: Captures the journey of our thinkingStructures insights accessibly for othersMaintains the conversational voiceIncludes proper citations and references Article Structure: --- title: &quot;[Topic] - A Conversational Exploration&quot; description: &quot;Key insights from our discussion on...&quot; conversation_date: &quot;2025-08-10&quot; participants: [&quot;Sam Brisson&quot;, &quot;Claude&quot;] source_materials: [list of materials we discussed] tags: [relevant topics] --- ## The Question That Started It All *Brief context for what sparked our conversation* ## Key Insights from Our Discussion *2-3 main takeaways, written accessibly* ## Patterns We Discovered *Frameworks or models that emerged* ## Questions That Emerged *What we want to explore further* ## Conversation Highlights *Memorable exchanges or &quot;aha moments&quot;* ## Source Materials &amp; References *What we read/discussed* ## Related Explorations *Links to other articles on the site* 4. Visual Asset Creation​ Generated as needed during article creation Types of Visuals: Concept Maps: Showing relationships between ideasProcess Diagrams: Communication flows or interaction patternsFramework Visualizations: Models we developConversation Maps: How ideas evolved during our discussion Technical Approach: SVG diagrams for scalability and web optimizationSimple, clean visual style consistent with DocusaurusInteractive elements when helpful for understanding 5. Knowledge Web Building​ Post-publication refinement and connection After publishing each article: Cross-reference with existing contentUpdate tags and categories for discoverabilityCreate connection points between related discussionsMaintain a &quot;conversation thread&quot; showing how ideas build over time File Organization Strategy​ ai-comm-patterns/ ├── docs/ │ ├── conversations/ # Main article directory │ │ ├── trust-patterns/ │ │ ├── collaborative-iteration/ │ │ └── transparency-models/ │ ├── concepts/ # Standalone concept definitions │ ├── frameworks/ # Reusable models we develop │ └── resources/ # Source material summaries ├── static/ │ └── img/ │ └── conversations/ # Visuals by conversation └── blog/ # Updates, reflections, meta-discussions Low-Friction Publishing Process​ During Our Conversation:​ No pressure to &quot;perform&quot; - just think togetherI take notes and track emerging insightsNatural tangents welcome - often where the best ideas emerge Immediately After:​ I generate the complete markdown fileCreate any needed visualsProvide you with ready-to-commit files Your Publishing Steps:​ # Simple three-command publish git add docs/conversations/[topic-name]/ git commit -m &quot;New conversation: [Topic Name]&quot; git push Community Contribution Ready:​ Clear attribution of our collaborative processIssue templates for others to suggest topicsDiscussion threads for community input on articlesContribution guidelines for extending our conversations Sample Weekly Rhythm​ Monday: You share interesting materials you've encounteredWednesday: We have our conversational explorationFriday: I deliver the complete article packageWeekend: You publish and we both reflect on connections to previous discussions Success Metrics​ Rather than page views or engagement, we measure: Depth of exploration - Are we uncovering new insights?Knowledge building - Are later conversations building on earlier ones?Personal learning - Is this serving your knowledge management goals?Community value - Are others finding and building on our work?

Energy starts high, people contribute ideas enthusiastically, but somewhere around the third or fourth iteration, fatigue sets in. Whether it's verbal discussions that devolve into arguments or visual sessions where redrawing becomes tedious, human collaboration hits predictable barriers.  We call this iteration fatigue—the point where the cognitive and physical effort of generating new versions outweighs the group's motivation to continue exploring.    Figure: Comparison of energy patterns across three collaboration approaches: Traditional Human, Visual Human, and AI-Enhanced collaboration. Notice how AI removes the iteration fatigue barrier that limits human-only approaches. This visual itself required 17-20 iterations, including 5 major tool pivots (SVG → Mermaid → React → HTML → PNG-optimized HTML) and 12-15 minor refinements (energy patterns, color consistency, spacing, text placement). We experienced firsthand the collaboration dynamics we were documenting.

We started with simple ideas but kept hitting barriers—SVG rendering issues, crowded layouts, color confusion. Each time we reached a technical iteration limit, we had to pivot approaches.  We experienced iteration fatigue firsthand. Our SVG attempts became too complex to modify cleanly. React components hit rendering issues. Only when we moved to simple HTML did we achieve the rapid iteration cycle we needed.  This mirrors exactly what happens in human collaboration: the medium itself can impose fatigue barriers that limit exploration depth.

We inadvertently used green and red for both &quot;energy levels&quot; (semantic meaning) and &quot;collaboration types&quot; (categorical grouping), creating visual conflicts that required multiple rounds to resolve.  The insight: Even in AI-enhanced collaboration, design standards matter. We could have saved 3-4 iterations by establishing upfront color guidelines:  Categorical data (people, groups): Colorblind-safe distinct hues (blue, orange, purple, teal)Sequential data (energy, progress): Single-hue scales (light→dark)Status/sentiment: Green=positive, Red=negative, Yellow=warning, Gray=neutralAccessibility: WCAG AA contrast ratios for text readability  Future prompt enhancement: Reference established design systems (Material Design, Apple HIG) to minimize stylistic iteration cycles and focus creative energy on conceptual breakthroughs rather than color debugging.  Suggested prompt addition for visual collaboration:  Use established design system color standards: - Categorical data (people, groups): Use colorblind-safe distinct hues (blue, orange, purple, teal) - Sequential data (energy, progress): Use single-hue scales (light→dark) - Status/sentiment: Green=positive, Red=negative, Yellow=warning, Gray=neutral - Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios for text readability - Reference Material Design or similar for semantic color meanings   This small discovery points to a larger principle: AI collaboration tools should incorporate domain expertise (like design standards) to reduce friction in specialized workflows.

Sam shifted from exploring concepts through the visual to optimizing it for audience communication—focusing on clarity, readability, and presentation polish rather than continued conceptual discovery.  This shift felt like progress but represented a hidden friction: the moment we started optimizing for external communication, we stopped optimizing for internal discovery. The visual went from being a thinking tool to becoming a presentation artifact.  The insight: Even in AI-enhanced collaboration, we unconsciously switch from &quot;thinking with&quot; to &quot;presenting to&quot; mode. This meta-friction kills exploratory momentum just as effectively as technical barriers—we stop asking &quot;what does this help us discover?&quot; and start asking &quot;how do we make this clear for others?&quot;  The parallel to traditional collaboration: This is exactly what happens in whiteboard sessions when someone starts &quot;making it look nice&quot; instead of &quot;making it think clearly.&quot; The polish impulse, while well-intentioned, prematurely ends the discovery phase.  AI's potential solution: Maintain parallel tracks—rough exploratory visuals optimized for thinking, alongside polished communication visuals for sharing. The AI could handle translation between modes without forcing us to choose.  This discovery points to our next experiment: How do we design AI collaboration that preserves discovery mode longer?

As I create content for the site, I will describe how I'm using AI, and reflect on how my thinking and approach are shaped by collaboration with Claude.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Create a Document","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-comm-patterns/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-document","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Create your first Doc​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Create a Document","url":"/ai-comm-patterns/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-document#create-your-first-doc","content":" Create a Markdown file at docs/hello.md:  docs/hello.md # Hello This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
